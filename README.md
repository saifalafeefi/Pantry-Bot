# Pantry Bot
 A raspberry pi program that assists in tracking kitchen ingedients, stocks, and even menus. An app that uses your raspberry pi (placed in front of the fridge door) that has a basic user-friendly UI and built-in keyboard.


# Things to make sure of:
- Install latest python, flutter (on windows), and the provided files.
- Install the provided files. Some files can be put in the desktop, while others inside the flutter folder.
- python program and database is reserved for the main raspberry pi device, you need to edit the custom domain for network access (mainly for the grocery list section).

This was an inspiration from my beloved family, and I wish to continue improving this until satisfaction.
